sdesc: "X11 passphrase dialog for ssh-add"
ldesc: "This is an X11-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.  It 
is intended as a lightweight alternative to the Perl/Tk-based 
ssh-askpass dialog and GNOME-based ssh-askpass dialog which accompany 
OpenSSH. These dialogs are intended to be called from the ssh-add 
program and not invoked directly."
